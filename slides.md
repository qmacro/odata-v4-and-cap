# Speaker

# What we'll cover

In this session we'll look at what the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) has to offer for the Open Data Protocol (OData) V4.

> While there is a version 4.01 of OData, the latest incarnation of which is from 2020, this talk covers the more widely known and implemented 4.0 version.

OData V4 (ISO/IEC)
```

<!--
OASIS's stewardship of the OData standard and the eventual submission to ISO/IEC meant a more structured set of standards documents and documentation process, leading to greater clarity and accuracy, but perhaps at the cost of complexity and more formal language.

SAP is a key member of the OASIS OData Technical Committee.
