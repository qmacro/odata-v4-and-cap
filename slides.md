OData V4 (ISO/IEC)
```

<!--
OASIS's stewardship of the OData standard and the eventual submission to ISO/IEC meant a more structured set of standards documents and documentation process, leading to greater clarity and accuracy, but perhaps at the cost of complexity and more formal language.

SAP is a key member of the OASIS OData Technical Committee.
