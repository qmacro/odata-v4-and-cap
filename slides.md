# Talk

OData V4 and SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

# Speaker

DJ Adams, Developer Advocate at SAP

# What we'll cover

In this session we'll look at what the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) has to offer for the Open Data Protocol (OData) V4. The latest incarnation of OData is 4.01. This talk covers the more widely known and implemented 4.0 version.

OData V4 (ISO/IEC)
```

<!--
OASIS's stewardship of the OData standard and the eventual submission to ISO/IEC meant a more structured set of standards documents and documentation process, leading to greater clarity and accuracy, but perhaps at the cost of complexity and more formal language.

SAP is a key member of the OASIS OData Technical Committee.

# OData specification documents

* Core specification components and related works
* Core components (plus errata):
  * Protocol (how it relates to HTTP)
  * URL Conventions (what you can do with OData URLs)
  * Common Schema Definition Language (metadata)
* Related and supporting works:
  * ABNF Construction Rules (formal grammar definition)
  * Core Vocabularies (Capabilities, Core and Measures)
  * Formats (Atom and JSON) and Schemas (EDMX and EDM)
* Extensions:
  * Data Aggregation
  * Temporal Data

The extension documents are Committee Specifications

# Navigating the OASIS documents

Different document types denoting position in drafting, review and approval flow:

# CAP features for OData

* See [Serving OData APIs](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/odata) in the Capire documentation

---

# New $search system query option

* Brand new system query option for cross-property text search
* See [Part 2: URL Conventions section 5.1.7 System Query Option $search](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata03/os/complete/part2-url-conventions/odata-v4.0-errata03-os-part2-url-conventions-complete.html#_Toc453752364)
* [Available for Node.js and Java](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/odata#overview)
* Use annotation `@cds.search` for more precise definitions (see [Searching Textual Data](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/providing-services#searching-data))

ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:4004/northwind-model/Categories?$search=products`

---

# Improved $expand

* In V4, expanded entities can be filtered, ordered, paged, etc with a more composable nested syntax
* `$expand=<navprop>(...)`
* Already some support for key system query options, in particular `$filter`, `$select` and `$orderby`
* [Some examples](sample/app/filter.html) (see [Part 4 - all things $filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9JyaPYtWKs&list=PL6RpkC85SLQDYLiN1BobWXvvnhaGErkwj&index=4))

ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:4004/northwind-model/Suppliers?$select=CompanyName&$expand=Products($orderby=UnitPrice;$filter=UnitsInStock gt 0;$select=ProductName,UnitPrice,UnitsInStock)`

---

# $count as system query option

* In V2, `$count` could be appended to a resource path for a raw scalar value response, and `$inlinecount` was a system query option
* In V4, `$count` is also now a system query option, replacing `$inlinecount`

ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:4004/northwind-model/Products/$count`

ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:4004/northwind-model/Products?$count=true`

---

# Data aggregation

* A committee specification level extension to V4 with early support in CAP
* Described in the document "OData Extension for Data Aggregation Version 4.0 (CS 02)"
* Implemented via the new `$apply` system query option, using:
  * Transformations (`filter`, `groupby` and `aggregate` supported currently)
  * Aggregation methods (`min`, `max`, `sum`, `average` etc)

ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:4004/northwind-model/Products?$apply=aggregate(UnitPrice%20with%20max%20as%20MostExpensive)`

ðŸ‘‰ `http://localhost:4004/northwind-model/Products?$apply=filter(Discontinued%20eq%20true)/groupby((Category_CategoryID),aggregate(UnitsInStock%20with%20sum%20as%20TotalStock))`
